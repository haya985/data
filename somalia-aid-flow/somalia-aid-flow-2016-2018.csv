Horumarinta Elmiga II (“Education for Empowerment through Cohesive and Harmonised System”),"Education plays a critical role in ensuring the developmental rights of children and young people and serves as a mean to achieve other rights and the overall development of a nation. The current gross enrolment level for Somaliland stands at 47%1 and educational access is much worse than the stated figures for children living in inaccessible locations, among Internally Displaced Populations (IDPs), pastoralists and girls in general.
The quality of education in Somaliland is generally low due to a lack of adequately trained education professionals (in particular female teachers) and qualified education professionals who are willing to serve outside major towns; absence of a unified curriculum and policy on medium of instruction; shortage of relevant, quality teaching and learning materials; absence of unified and effective quality assurance systems etc. Through the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), the consortium will build on and strengthen long-term collaboration and relationships with children, youth, civil society organizations, the donor community, governments, international agencies and education umbrella organizations to share experience, build knowledge, advocate for and strengthen the capacity of children and partners to promote children’s right to quality education. The consortium will establish, train, and support Community Education Committees (CECs) to enable them to identify and implement local solutions for the challenges faced in the targeted communities under this action. The underlying assumption is that working with children, youth, their parents/caretakers, teachers and communities will eventually lead to more relevant programmes that ensure long term positive effects.
Looking at the education sector as a whole ensures that broad national goals and related strategies can be factored into a comprehensive national education framework and that national outcomes are focussed on irrespective of inputs at the level of each sub-sector. Through the SWAp, this action will seek to achieve the following overall objective: “Education and training efficiently and effectively contributing to poverty alleviation within a peaceful, secure and democratic Somaliland” with the following specific objective: “Education and training services, responsive to the priorities, needs and requirements of the population of Somaliland, efficiently and equitably delivered”.
The consortium fully recognises the advantages of a SWAp to education, where each sub-sector needs to be treated in relation to its contribution to the education sector as a whole. This will ensure that all educational initiatives provide a countrywide improvement across all sub-sectors, as opposed to ”islands of excellence” that have limited impact at system level. In other words, making the whole greater than the sum of its parts. In addition, the educational sector as a whole covers early childhood to adulthood.

Strengthening Education and Training in Somalia (SETS),"This action specifically seeks to support the local government both at national and state levels to address its education priorities and inclusive education needs in Banadir region, Jubbaland, South West, Galmudug and Hir-Shabelle states. It is expected to contribute to a conducive environment for returnees, IDPs, pastoralists and other groups to be re-integrated in the education system. Minority groups, children, women, persons with disability, girls and youth will be targeted for inclusive quality education and vocational training services, in order for them to participate in activities leading to poverty reduction, and a peaceful, secure and democratic Somalia. The action is planned to expand availability and accessibility to equitable and inclusive education services for all population groups as result of improved governance and evidence-based management of education at all levels (school, district, regional and national).

Waxbarashadu Waa Iftiin II - Education is light II,"This project will consolidate and expand the gains achieved through Waxbarashadu Waa Iftiin I. Waxbarashadu Waa Iftiin II has been formulated through extensive dialogue between the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MoE&HE), consortium partners and the European Union (EU). This objective was set together with the EU and contributes to overarching EU strategy in which strengthened education plays a fundamental role in poverty alleviation, peace and security. This will be achieved through a strategic, sector wide programme that holistically addresses the key constraints that face Puntland learners in accessing quality educational services.
Specific objective: Education and training services, responsive to the priority requirements of the Somali population, efficiently and equitably delivered
The specific objective will be achieved through the delivery of the three results described below. Building on the achievements of Waxbarashadu Waa Iftiin I, these results focus on delivering expanded and enhanced services across the following education sub-sectors: Primary Education (PE) (including pastoralist/mobile education), Secondary Education (SE), Non Formal Education (NFE), Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET), Higher Education(HE), and strengthening institutional capacity of the MoE&HE at central and decentralised levels along with capacity development of TVET institutions and Higher Education Institutes (HEIs).",9/13/15,3/12/18,Pillar 7: Social & Human Development,Education,EU,EU,STICHTING CARE NEDERLAND,NGOs,Not funded through MDTF,7777778,NA,2016,1888889,Puntland
